# Cyber Attack & Password Cracking Analysis

Overview
This project is part of my MSc Cybersecurity coursework (COMP6224 - Foundations of Cyber Security, 2023/24).  
It demonstrates my ability to perform a **cyber attack kill chain analysis** and **password cracking** using real security tools and frameworks.

Objectives
- Analyze a multi-stage cyber attack using the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain model
- Profile attackers (Cybercriminal, Nation-State, Insider)
- Perform password cracking on sample datasets using **John the Ripper**
- Compare dictionary attacks vs brute-force attacks
- Evaluate password weaknesses against best practices

Tools & Frameworks
- **John the Ripper** (Password cracking)
- **MITRE ATT&CK** (Threat mapping)
- Linux command line
- Custom and publicly available password wordlists

Key Findings
- Dictionary attacks were significantly faster than brute-force for common passwords
- Passwords with predictable patterns (dates, keyboard sequences, common words) were most vulnerable
- Effective password policies require length, complexity, and resistance to dictionary-based attacks
